<h1>Pun Finder</h1>

<p>Give me a word, I'll give you some puns. <a href="https://puns.samueltaylor.org/">Try it out here</a>! Also available as an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samuel-Taylor-Pun-Finder/dp/B07959NLWB/">Alexa
skill</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago, a friend was looking for a new Instagram handle. Many Instagram
handles are puns (e.g. a person named Fred might have the handle
"BreathOfFredAir"). I was curious to see if I could create an algorithm to find
puns. Within about an hour in a Jupyter Notebook, I had something decent
working. I made a website to show it off the day after, and got a decent amount
of love around the internet. Here's hourly traffic numbers:</p>

<p>I initially posted to Show HN, then somebody posted on ProductHunt. I'm not sure
what the second big spike is; feel free to <a href="mailto:puns@samueltaylor.org">email
me</a> with any theories!</p>

<p>In January 2018, I decided to learn something new by building a version of this as an Alexa skill. If you have an
Alexa-enabled device, I would love to hear your feedback on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samuel-Taylor-Pun-Finder/dp/B07959NLWB/">the
skill</a>.</p>
