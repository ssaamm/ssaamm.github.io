<h1>Idea</h1>

<p>Deaf people have significant things to offer to society, yet they are often left
out of critical dialogues because of communication barriers.</p>

<p>ASL tutor is Rosetta Stone for sign language; it helps people learn American
Sign Language in a fun, easy way. We show users an image of a particular sign
and use skeletal tracking combined with machine learning to detect the physical
location/orientation of your hand and determine what sign you are making.</p>

<h1>Tech used</h1>

<ol class="section-content">
<li>Leap Motion -- used for the skeletal tracking. We were able to get sixty
parameters of data about the human hand out of the SDK, which was extremely
useful.</li>
<li>scikit-learn -- used for the machine learning algorithms. We analyzed roughly
ten different classification algorithms before settling on a support vector
classifier with parameters tuned to our specific data set.</li>
<li>Python/Flask -- used for the front end. We feel comfortable with web
technologies, so we decided to use them to build the front end of our
application.</li>
<li>SQLAlchemy/Redis -- used for storing training data for the machine learning
algorithms and for storing the scoreboard.</li>
</ol>

<p>I wrote more about the process of building it in my <a href="/articles/tamuhack-2015.html">writeup of TAMUHack
2015</a>.</p>

<h1>Future improvements</h1>

<p>Currently, ASL Tutor is only able to recognize the alphabet, but we'd like to
improve it to be able to recognize any sign.</p>

<p>The "game" aspect of it was mostly devised as a fun way to demo our sign
language recognition at a hackathon. Turns out that it's legitimately fun, but I
think there are other applications of this technology as well. For example, it
would be cool to build an on-the-fly translator for ASL.</p>
