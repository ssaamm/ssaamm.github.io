<h1>ClearCall</h1>

<p>ClearCall provides automated scheduling of the on call calendar for college
RA's.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://matttinsley.org/">Matt Tinsley</a> and I created it. Inspired by how
pointlessly inefficient it was for our head RA to create the on call schedule
each month, we made a system to gather everyone's availability and automatically
create a schedule that is as fair as possible.</p>

<p>My primary responsibility has been to develop the algorithm for creating the
schedule, which has been a fun challenge. Considering a residence hall can has
to have two RA's on call and there can be thirteen RA's, the number of possible
schedules is quite large. I am pleased to have created an algorithm which is
able to handle such a large number of possibilities in seconds (and that's on a
Core2Duo running at 1.3GHz).</p>

<p>The site is still in testing, so it's not public yet. If you're interested in
learning more, please email me at sgt@samueltaylor.org.</p>
