<h1>Course Watch</h1>

<p><a href="http://coursewatch.tk/">Course Watch</a> is a tool for students to get into
classes that are already full.</p>

<p>At Baylor, many courses don't have a waitlist, so when a class you want to get
into is full, you can't simply get on the waitlist. Instead, you end up logging
into the registration website over and over, hoping that there will be a slot
open for you. We hated having to do that, so we made a computer do it for us.</p>

<p>All you have to do is text the course number of the course you want to get into
to a specific phone number. Then, once your class opens up, you'll get a text
that lets you know a seat is available.</p>

<p>The site is live at <a href="http://coursewatch.tk/">CourseWatch.tk</a>; feel free to play with it. <del>If it's not course
registration season, the behavior will be a little bit different than if registration is open, but hopefully you can get
a sense for how it works.</del> Update from the future: we no longer maintain this project. Hopefully the site is still
up so you can see a little "demo" screenshot.</p>

<p>Wes Cossick, Evan Green, and I developed Course Watch at <a href="../articles/hacktx-2014.html">HackTX
2014</a>. For the project, we won the TripAdvisor
Prize, Best Use of Microsoft Azure, and Best Use of SendGrid.</p>
