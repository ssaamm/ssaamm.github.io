<h1>Social and Drift-Aware Collaborative Filtering</h1>

<p>For my CSI 5325 (Introduction to Machine Learning) class, I worked on a project
which explored improvement on collaborative filtering by (a) taking into account
social data when calculating user similarity and (b) taking into account changes
in user similarity over time (for example, two people may like the same
Christmas movies and give lots of similar ratings in December, but diverge
significantly afterward).</p>
