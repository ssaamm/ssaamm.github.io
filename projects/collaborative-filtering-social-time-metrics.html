<h1>Social and Drift-Aware Collaborative Filtering</h1>

<p>I am interested in the task of recommending new items to users. Roughly
speaking, the input to this task is a set of (user, item, rating) tuples (that
is to say, <code>$user</code> gave <code>$item</code> a rating of <code>$rating</code>) as well as a specific
user for whom to generate a recommendation. The output is an item (or
potentially a set of items) that the user has not already rated, but ideally
will rate highly.</p>

<p>Systems to do this are called recommender systems. One technique often used in
recommender systems is collaborative filtering, in which users are recommended
items that are liked by other users with similar rating histories. A principle
of collaborative filtering is that similar users like similar things.</p>

<p>For my CSI 5325 (Introduction to Machine Learning) class, I am attempting an
improvement on collaborative filtering by (a) taking into account social data
when calculating user similarity and (b) taking into account changes in user
similarity over time (for example, two people may like the same Christmas movies
and give lots of similar ratings in December, but diverge significantly
afterward). The hope is that this view of user similarity, being aware of both
social data and change over time, could improve rating accuracy.</p>

<p>People have already researched social network-based recommender systems
<a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-6287-4_4">[1]</a> with good
results (friends often like the same kinds of things). Some of the problems with
collaborative filtering can be circumvented by calculating user similarity using
social data.</p>

<p>There is also promising research on accounting for drift in user interests
<a href="http://dse.fmi.uni-sofia.bg/HomePages/IvanKoychev/papers/ECAI2000_WSTR.pdf">[2]</a>
(e.g. someone may have a phase of really liking kung fu movies, but stop
enjoying them after some time). Gradual forgetting is used to give more weight
to recent ratings and more accurately reflect a user's interests at a given
time. Having this drift-aware view of user interests is useful in content based
filtering. I don't think much (if any) research has been done on the drift in
user similarity (though I'm willing to be wrong about this).</p>

<p>I am interested in exploring the drift in user similarity (based both on social
data and calculated via collaborative filtering) to see if a system aware of
user similarity drift can improve rating accuracy. As of right now, I am hopeful
that I can use gradual forgetting to weight more recent similarities between
users to improve on collaborative filtering.</p>
