<h1>Coffee and the Word</h1>

<p>I created a website called <a href="http://coffeeandtheword.tk/">Coffee and the Word</a>
which displays a different passage from the Bible each day. It is intentionally
simple and designed with readers in mind. This article describes the development
of the project from idea to maintenance.</p>

<h2>Idea</h2>

<p>I have followed <a href="http://www.bibledesignblog.com">Bible Design Blog</a> for several
months and have gained an appreciation for the design of Bibles. Some time this
summer, the author posted several times about Bibles designed to be read more
like a narrative and less like a reference book. One such Bible is called
Bibliotheca. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/530877925/bibliotheca">The
Kickstarter</a> was
very successful--it currently has $1.4 million pledged. When I saw the project's
success, I thought that perhaps people had started caring about design
aspects of the Bible.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I had the idea to create a website that displayed passages
from the Bible which prioritized design.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>I serve as a Resident Assistant at my university, and I was on call for
Thanksgiving break. I had time and wanted to strengthen my front end and design
skills, so I took to my Trello board of project ideas and looked for something
interesting. This one fit the bill.</p>

<h2>Initial execution</h2>

<p>I found a site online that had Bible reading plans, picked on that looked good,
and wrote <a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/just-the-word/blob/master/tools/parse.py">a small Python
script</a> to
parse the HTML representation of the plan, turning it into <a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/just-the-word/blob/master/tools/plan.txt">a text
file</a>. From
there, it was easier to get the reading plan inserted into a SQLite database.</p>

<p>I don't anticipate running into legal issues over the fact that I basically
stole a reading plan because I don't think this project will garner much
attention.</p>

<p>After figuring out the passages I would be displaying each day, I turned to
actually retrieving their text. I found <a href="http://www.esvapi.org/">Crossway's ESV Bible web
service</a> and decided to use it. I have interacted with
web services in Python before using <code>urllib2</code>, but wanted to try out the
<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">Requests library</a>. Requests is
awesome. The library made creating web requests much simpler than I remember it
being using <code>urllib2</code>.</p>

<p>Initially, the website made a request to the Bible API every time it was
accessed. Keeping this API access within a specific class later allowed me to
implement caching of the text by changing only <a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/just-the-word/commit/af168e6bfd6e413836f9cf787c4509ec6b3c904b">one
class</a>.
Caching improved my page's load time on <code>localhost</code> from about 400ms to around
5ms. I was pleased but not surprised by that improvement (web requests can be
expensive).</p>

<p>I thought about using Redis for caching (because it's fast) but decided to use
SQLite because I did not want to add more dependencies. Additionally, for the
purposes of this project, I was not especially concerned about performance. I
still think it would be interesting to see how using Redis for caching would
stack up to my current SQLite-based approach from a performance perspective.</p>

<p>Another option was to go through the reading plan I had stored, fetching all of
the verses in advance. Then, I wouldn't have to make any requests to the Bible
API in the future. There were a few reasons I didn't do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Storing that many verses is against the API's ToS</li>
<li>It would have been harder to implement than caching</li>
<li>It's not worth it--Yes, a single request per day is going to take
significantly longer to process, but I think that one user can wait half a
second.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Polishing</h2>

<p>In an attempt to polish the site, I turned my attention to branding and design.</p>

<p>Initially, I named the site "Just the Word," because that's what it was. I
wanted to come up with something more interesting yet still simple. On a whim, I
decided to make a reference to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My92oE9RwRE">Sh*tuff Christian Girls
Say</a> and chose "Coffee and the
Word." I found a coffee stain brush set online, changed a few lines of HTML, and
was done
(<a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/just-the-word/commit/625f95c593bfcae54a44c287d6333a6824deef6a">625f95c</a>).</p>

<p>With the brand figured out, I turned to improving the design of the site. I tend
to favor simple designs. I have very little knowledge of design, but my
uneducated eye does not enjoy busy-looking pages. As an added bonus, it was way
easier to make the site simple than it would have been to make it look fancy.</p>

<p>I tried to follow <em>Practical Typography</em>'s <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html">Summary of Key
Rules</a>. I used
<a href="http://www.typegenius.com/">TypeGenius</a> to decide on what fonts to use. As
someone with no background in graphic design, I appreciate these resources
because they at least give me somewhere to start.</p>

<p>I had not done much with responsive web design, so I was excited to learn more.
I found Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/">Responsive Web Design
Basics</a>
and implemented some things I learned. The most interesting thing I learned was
how to apply different stylesheets based on browser size
(<a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/just-the-word/commit/2af63195d79633b30c3384107bbca48077128069">2af6319</a>).</p>

<p>I had set the coffee stain image's width to be 50% of the document's width,
which looked good until the window became wider than twice the width of the
coffee stain image. At this point, the image was stretched beyond its 500px
width, and the scaling made it look pixelated. I separated out the
<code>background-size</code> rules into a separate stylesheet and used a <code>media</code> attribute
to make those rules only apply up to a width of 1000px.</p>

<h2>Production-izing</h2>

<p>I have a server through <a href="http://www.cloudatcost.com/">CloudAtCost</a> that I rent
for $9 per year using a coupon code. It runs Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 LTS. I'm
using a free domain name on the <a href="http://dot.tk/">.tk TLD</a>.</p>

<p>Deploying the application turned out to be more difficult than I anticipated.  I
hadn't deployed a Flask app, so I read and tried to follow multiple guides with
limited success. Eventually, I had luck following <a href="https://realpython.com/blog/python/kickstarting-flask-on-ubuntu-setup-and-deployment/">this
guide</a>,
which used Supervisor, Nginx, and Gunicorn on Ubuntu.</p>

<p>I then set up <a href="http://dploy.io">dploy.io</a> to be able to easily deploy future
changes. The service will copy over changed files and then restart the app with
the press of a button; I find it convenient.</p>

<p>I searched for a website monitoring service and found
<a href="http://monitor.us">monitor.us</a>. It was easy enough to set up, and I get daily
emails with a summary of both uptime and response times.</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>I made a simple website which displays a different Bible passage every day. I
gained experience with responsive web design, deployment, and monitoring. Some
technologies used include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python/Flask</li>
<li>HTML/CSS</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
<li>Nginx</li>
<li>Gunicorn</li>
</ul>
