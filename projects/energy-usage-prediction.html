<h1>Energy Usage Prediction</h1>

<p>Millions of dollars are at stake for Texas energy retailers. Due to the
deregulated energy market, being able to accurately forecast future energy usage
can have a large impact on a retailer's profit.</p>

<p>For Baylor's Spring 2016 Capstone Design project, my team and I are responsible
for creating a system that predicts future energy load. This project is ongoing,
so this page will likely change.</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>We decided to build microservices for this project. One of my group mates had
experience using them in production, and I'd been wanting to get some hands-on
experience with them.</p>

<p>Because I enjoy data problems and machine learning, I called dibs on
designing/implementing the service which did the predictions. To design the
service, I worked with my primary team member who would be consuming the
service. Designing the interface in this way was a good choice because we were
able to talk through implementation issues and usage issues.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>After we were done writing our notes on a whiteboard, I wrote tests (using
<code>pytest</code>) for each bit of functionality we came up with. Having something to
shoot for, I was then able to implement the service. This test-driven
development process was useful for me, because I could see tests lighting up
green as I got things working. I also like the idea of having tests because they
can ensure the interface is being followed.</p>
