<h1>Energy Usage Prediction</h1>

<p>Millions of dollars are at stake for Texas energy retailers. Due to the
deregulated energy market, being able to accurately forecast future energy usage
can have a large impact on a retailer's profit.</p>

<p>For Baylor's Spring 2016 Capstone Design project, my team and I were responsible
for creating a system that predicts future energy load. The slides for our final
presentation are available <a href="/static/pdf/CSI43C9-FinalPresentation.pdf">here</a>. If
you have any questions, please don't hesitate to email me; I can be reached at
