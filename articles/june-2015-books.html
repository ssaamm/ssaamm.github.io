<h1>Books I read in June 2015</h1>

<p>This month, I read four books:</p>

<ul>
<li>Till We Have Faces, C.S. Lewis</li>
<li>A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson</li>
<li>Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck</li>
<li>Into the Wild, Jon Krakauer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Till We Have Faces, C.S. Lewis</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed this one. It is a re-telling by Lewis of myth of Psyche and
Cupid. I was unfamiliar with the original myth, but appreciated this book very
much.</p>

<p>I particularly enjoyed the clash in worldviews between a physically-oriented
worldview and one which stressed the importance of supernatural beings. The
differing advice offered to Orual by the Fox and the captain of the king's guard
is intriguing. The relationship between reason and faith is interesting, so I
enjoyed watching Orual process her thoughts on the world through the book.</p>

<p>The book also stands out as a well-written story. I enjoyed the pace of it, and
I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys mythology.</p>

<h2>A Walk in the Woods, Bill Bryson</h2>

<p>This was a good read. Every once in a while, I would start to get a little bored
by the writing about the history or biology of the Appalachian Trail, but then
Bryson would say something to the effect of, "Enough science for now, back to
the interesting stuff."</p>

<p>I enjoyed the interactions between Bryson, Katz, and others they ran into on the
trail.</p>

<p>On an unrelated note, as of writing, Scott Jurek was about to break the FKT for
the AT. Jurek is an impressive athlete, and it's awesome to see such a huge
accomplishment.</p>

<h2>Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck</h2>

<p>Quick read -- I think it took me an afternoon. I hadn't been spoiled for it, so
I didn't know what was coming. This book was very sad, but in an enjoyable way.
In a way, the ending sort of snuck up on me. I was observing the world Steinbeck
set before me, and then suddenly the ending came. It felt abrupt, and it felt
sad.</p>

<h2>Into the Wild, Jon Krakauer</h2>

<p>While I wasn't a fan of how much Krakauer seemed to revere McCandless, I enjoyed
hearing about McCandless's journey.</p>
