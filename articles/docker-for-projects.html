<h1>Host all your projects on one machine with Docker</h1>
<p>Like many digital builders/hackers/makers, I have <a href="../projects/index.html">several
projects</a> that I want to put on the internet. I don't,
however, want to have loads of servers to manage. Given that the highest-traffic
project I maintain only around 100 unique visitors a day, it's feasible for me
to host them all on the same node.</p>
<p>I already deploy these things in Docker containers, so I imagined I could use
nginx to solve this problem. It would work, I imagined, by having a single
Docker host running an nginx container that would reverse proxy requests to
other containers (which would be running the aforementioned projects). When I
started researching how to do this, I found a great project that made it super
easy.</p>
<p>Jason Wilder has a <a href="http://jasonwilder.com/blog/2014/03/25/automated-nginx-reverse-proxy-for-docker/">great
post</a>
that you should read if you want more detail, but the gist is that
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jwilder/nginx-proxy/">jwilder/nginx-proxy</a> is an nginx
container that proxies to other containers. It automatically configures nginx
based on the <code>EXPOSE</code>d ports of the containers you're running, which is almost
magical.</p>
<p>Start it up like this:</p>
<p><code>docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock -t jwilder/nginx-proxy</code></p>
<p>You can make this even cooler with a bit of fiddling with your DNS records. Add
an A record that points to the Docker host, then add a wildcard CNAME that
points to the URL you set up in the A record (see screenshot below for how I
have it set up).</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/dns_config.png" alt="DNS configuration"></img></p>
<p>(where "1.2.3.4" is the IP of your Docker host)</p>
<p>Now, you can start up a container with a <code>VIRTUAL_HOST</code> environment variable
that is in that subdomain:</p>
<p><code>docker run -e 'VIRTUAL_HOST=rss.project.samueltaylor.org' -tid ssaamm/rss_filter</code></p>
<p>When you navigate to this URL, your browser will ask your nginx container for
the site at that URL, and that container will know to reverse proxy the request
to the container you just started. Nifty!</p>
