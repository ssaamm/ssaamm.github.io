<h1>Wherever you are, be all there</h1>
<p>Being present (paying attention to the here and now) and purposeful (taking
actions to achieve some end) helps us to live more fulfilling lives. Jim Elliot
once said, "wherever you are, be all there." While it is often painted on
flowery backdrops and put on the walls of suburban homes, this quote holds
useful advice for productivity and professional growth.</p>
<p>If you're doing something, you should apply all your efforts to that thing, and
avoid distractions or other tasks. Turn off your phone, close your chat program,
and just work. When your brain encounters a difficult task like learning a new
skill or solving a challenging problem, it tries to avoid spending the energy on
that hard thing. Instead, you'll suddenly feel the urge to check your text
messages or open up Twitter.  Your brain might start reminding you about the
fact that you need to schedule a doctor's appointment or get your car washed.
You've got to fight these urges, or you'll get derailed from the task at hand
and become less productive. You will be more productive if you focus on and
complete your current task and then apply all your focus to (for instance)
scheduling a doctor's appointment than you would if you try to do both at once.
To help avoid your brain's weakling pleas for relief from the mental workout,
many people find it useful to set a timer for a set period of working on a
specific task (see for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">the Pomodoro
technique</a>).</p>
<p>This quote is also great career development advice. Wherever you find yourself
professionally, you should use the resources at your disposal to your maximum
advantage. Find the truly great people at your company and try to learn from
them. Take them to coffee and ask them how they are so effective. Ask them to
critique your work. Over the course of your daily interactions, observe how
they handle situations you would be uncomfortable in. Beyond the people at your
company, try to get yourself assigned to projects that stretch your abilities.</p>
<p>Life is more rewarding when we live purposefully in the present. By focusing on
one task at a time and making the most of our resources, we can become better
people and find more fulfillment.</p>
