<h1>How to train data scientists and engineers</h1>
<p>Most companies with personal development budgets are wasting their money. If the
goal is to help employees master valuable skills, then we are misallocating
funds to books and conferences. Instead, we should look at what the research on
skill development says so that we can make decisions informed by data.</p>
<p>Great people are hard to find, especially in software engineering and data
science. The people who you want to hire probably work for your competitors and
make more than you can afford to pay them. If instead of finding employees that
are already great you could help employees become great, then the process of
doing that would become a huge competitive advantage.</p>
<p>I recently read the book <em>Peak</em> by Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool. In it, the
authors espouse the value of deliberate practice and offer research-backed
insight into effective training practices. How might a company go about creating
top-tier talent?</p>
<p>Before we talk about what works, let's think about what doesn't:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>attending lectures, minicourses, and the like offers little or no feedback and
little or no chance to try something new, make mistakes, correct the mistakes,
and gradually develop a new skill</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, many corporate training budgets are set up to send people to
lectures and minicourses rather than building good training programs. The
authors offer advice on how we might train doctors, though we could adapt their
recommendations to the tech industry.</p>
<p>The first step is to find the experts. Ideally we could do this on a global
scale, determining the greatest data scientists in the world. Unfortunately,
even determining a methodology to find these people sounds prohibitively complex
and difficult. Fortunately, we can settle for an approximation. Bringing an
average engineer to the level of elite talent on the world stage would be
incredible, don't get me wrong, but even getting that person to perform like the
best engineer at the company would be a huge win.</p>
<p>Finding the top talent at your company may involve: asking various individuals
who they hold in particularly high regard, examining performance review data,
and/or determining which individuals have had the greatest positive impact on
the business. If you're fortunate enough to have access to brilliant individuals
outside your company, all the better!</p>
<p>Once we've found these experts, we move on to step two: understanding how they
think about problems. Ericsson and Pool go so far as saying that the "main
purpose of deliberate practice is to develop effective mental representations."</p>
<p>Having done this crucial work of understanding highly effective individuals, our
third step is to build a "Top Gun" school. Modeled after an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_Strike_Fighter_Tactics_Instructor_program">effective strategy
for training fighter
pilots</a>,
<em>Peak</em>'s authors recommend creating training programs that simulate the real thing
as well as possible while dramatically lowering the cost of failure. In our
industry, this might mean identifying a few JIRA tickets representative of a
team's work and having trainees work them under the watchful eye of high-quality
instructors. These instructors should point out failures to their students and
help the students to develop the thought processes (i.e.  mental
representations) of high performers.</p>
<p>Note that we're not developing coursework on design patterns, data warehouse
design, deep learning, or a certain JavaScript framework. Instead, we focus on
doing the work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the implicit themes of the Top Gun approach to training, whether it is
for shooting down enemy planes or interpreting mammograms [or developing a
predicting widget manufacturing capacity], is the emphasis on doing.  The
bottom line is what you are able to do, not what you know</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Building great teams isn't easy, but it is incredibly valuable. More than just
spending $50 on eBooks, companies should create training programs that use
data-driven insights into skill development to bring each team member to the
level of our best performers. Great products come from great teams, and great
teams are formed of great individuals. Great individuals are formed through
deliberate practice.</p>
