<h1>How to: get free WiFi at coffee shops</h1>

<p>Some coffee shops place time limitations on their WiFi. For example, I recently
went to a Panera that had a 30 minute time limit on their WiFi during lunch
hours.</p>

<p>Getting around such limits isn't difficult. I'm not sure how ethical it is to do
so, so consider this all merely educational information.</p>

<p>It seems these kinds of systems track you based on your MAC address. If your MAC
address changes, the system thinks of you as a new user. Changing your MAC
address is easy enough (on Linux):</p>

<ol class="section-content">
<li><p>Figure out what interface you're using.</p>

<p>Run <code>ifconfig</code> and look for the one that looks like right. Mine was <code>wlan0</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Change your MAC address</p>

<p>ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6
ifconfig wlan0 up</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For ease of changing, you can make a script that looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether $1
ifconfig wlan0 up
</code></pre>

<p>And then run it like <code>./change_mac.sh a1:b2:c3:d4:e5:f6</code>.</p>
