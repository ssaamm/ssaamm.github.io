<h1>APChemSolutions review - do not buy</h1>
<p><em>Author's note: this is not what I usually write about. If you're an educator
considering purchasing a product from apchemsolutions.com, please read on!
Otherwise, don't worry about it.</em></p>
<h2>Executive summary</h2>
<p>An educator I know recently contacted me for some IT help with a product they
had purchased from apchemsolutions.com (AKA AP Chem Solutions). In helping this
person, I was appalled by the level of contempt the creator(s) of this product
have for their users. <strong>I strongly recommend against purchasing anything from AP
Chem Solutions</strong> (which uses the domain apchemsolutions.com).</p>
<h2>More detail</h2>
<p>I completely understand that companies have a right to protect their
intellectual property. However, AP Chem Solutions chooses to use DRM (digital
rights management) software which harms its customers. Here are a few reasons I
think their product is bad:</p>
<h3>1. Jumping through hoops</h3>
<p>The educator who reached out to me receives an email with instructions on how to
open the PDF files in the provided ZIP file. First, the user must have Adobe
Reader installed. Then, there is a set of six to seven items which describe how
to install a certificate on your computer. Then, there are a further 5 steps to
get Adobe Reader set up to actually read the PDF's.</p>
<p>I have a degree in computer science, and I found these steps to be frustrating
and annoying. It is no wonder that this person needed help! While I have immense
respect for teachers, the amount of hoops this company expects them to jump
through is beyond anything I would expect a teacher at any level to accomplish
on their own.</p>
<h3>2. Administrative access</h3>
<p>Which brings us to the next point: admin access. To import this certificate in
the first place, the customer is expected to enter the admin password for the
computer. This might be all fine and dandy, except that it is rare for teachers
to have admin access to the computers provided them by the school.</p>
<p>You know how much of a pain it is to interact with your IT department? Well, if
you want to use this product, you're going to have to bug IT. And they might not
want to help you with this. It's a very real possibility that your request will
get denied and you will be completely unable to use the product you purchased
from AP Chem Solutions.</p>
<h3>3. Small annoyances</h3>
<p>All of my other concerns are more important than any of the minor things I'm
listing here, but I wanted to list them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instructions are at times unclear or poorly written. I can easily see someone
  getting confused trying to follow them.</li>
<li>Instructions are at times factually inaccurate (e.g. you don't need to set
  your default PDF reader to Adobe Reader)</li>
<li>You cannot use these materials on operating systems other than Windows or
  macOS (because Adobe Reader isn't available on other platforms)</li>
<li>They require you to disable some security features of Adobe Reader. I am not a
  cybersecurity buff, but I imagine this exposes your computer to additional
  risk of viruses and/or malware.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Printing restrictions</h3>
<p>Finally, the reason this company has had you jump through all these hoops in the
first place: to keep you from printing or redistributing certain portions of
the materials they have provided you. Would you like to print a copy of the
slides for your students or a sub? You can't!</p>
<p>And forget about sharing the PDF's digitally; anyone you send them to will have
to go through the same setup process you did. Good luck explaining that to them.</p>
<h2>An alternative</h2>
<p>Rather than use restrictive, draconian DRM software, AP Chem Solutions should
put its customers first. The company should provide its customers what they
believe they have purchased: access to materials that will help them make
students more successful free from restrictive DRM. Teachers, who are already
overburdened, <em>should not have to have a four year degree in computers just to
use a product they have purchased</em>.</p>
<p>To reiterate: <strong>please do not buy anything from AP Chem Solutions</strong>, which
operates on the domain name apchemsolutions.com. It appears they care more about
lining their pockets than they do about your ability to actually use the product
you purchased.</p>
