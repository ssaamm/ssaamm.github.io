<h1>The Last 5 Books I Read (June 2016)</h1>
<p>(I'll be updating this page as I keep reading more)</p>
<h2>A View from the Bridge, Arthur Miller</h2>
<p>This is a script I read for my American Literature class. It was alright. Even
though it has a distant setting, the characters still feel real. They each have
their own needs/desires which conflict in certain ways, which causes the
drama/action. My favorite scene is one in which they're all in the apartment,
and Catherine and Rodolfo start dancing. The subtext in that scene is very
interesting.</p>
<p>People talk about the ending being shocking, and I don't know that I agree.
There's enough foreshadowing and character development that it isn't a surprise.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a fine script. I imagine it's better as an actual staged
performance, and I would probably go see it if I knew it was being performed.</p>
<h2>Questions for All your Answers, Roger E. Olson</h2>
<p>This would have been a good book to give a 13 year old version of myself. At
that time, I was struggling with how anti-intellectual the church seemed.
Fortunately, for a few reasons I came to find and appreciate the intellectual
tradition of Christianity. As such, I don't think I'm necessarily the target
audience for the book. Reading it is still enjoyable, but it's not
earth-shattering for me.</p>
<p>More generally, Olson seems to be caught in the awkward task of speaking
intellectually and theologically to an audience hostile (or apathetic, at best)
toward theological thinking. His writing feels at times pulled in different
direction. In one corner, he's trying to explain complicated theological lines
of thought. In another corner, he's trying to keep it simple enough that people
without much theological background can understand it.</p>
<p>That said, there are still parts of the book that I liked. The third chapter was
particularly good; it talks about cultural sensitivity and the Trinity in a very
practical way that still respects the ideas.</p>
<h1>Room, Emma Donoghue</h1>
<p>I watched the movie adaptation on a plane and enjoyed it thoroughly. The book is
written from the perspective of a child, which seems like an annoying premise.
At times the perspective is a bit annoying, but overall I was surprised by how
well it worked.</p>
<p>All in all, I enjoyed it a good deal. Because of the narrator's limited
knowledge, I was constantly intrigued and kept reading to find out more. While I
didn't, you could probably read it in one sitting as it's relatively short.</p>
<h1>Ready Player One, Ernest Cline</h1>
<p>I didn't like the main character at the beginning of the book, which was not
enjoyable. I suppose you could argue that this is Cline setting up for some
character development, but that isn't a satisfying answer. Ideally, there would
be a way to establish that the character is hauty without making readers hate
him. Luckily, Parzival/Wade became a more interesting, less prideful character
as I got further in the book.</p>
<p>At times, something would happen in the book that felt irrelevant enough to the
plot that I would be drawn out of the action and start wondering how he was
going to use that later in the book (he always did end up using or referencing
it). I understand that foreshadowing is neat, but it felt a little obvious.</p>
<p>Some of the hacking felt unrealistic. Even within the context of a SciFi
universe, it doesn't seem like these sensitive systems should be so easily
hackable.</p>
<p>Despite these criticisms, this was a very enjoyable read. Admittedly, I'm a
nerd, so I don't know how the reference-laden prose would feel to someone who's
not a fan of nerdy books and games. The book never felt like it was dragging,
which made reading it a good time.</p>
