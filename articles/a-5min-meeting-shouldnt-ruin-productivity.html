<h1>A five minute meeting shouldn't ruin your productivity</h1>
<p>As developers, we deplore being interrupted. A stream of Twitter posts lament
that a five minute meeting can harm productivity for hours. But it doesn't have
to be like this: we can dramatically decrease the cost of being interrupted with
a simple technique.  What's more, implementing this technique makes us more
effective and confident in our work.</p>
<h2>Problems with this narrative</h2>
<p>I can't talk about this without first critiquing it. The framing of these
complaints is often adversarial.</p>

<p>When we create a "developers vs. others" mentality, we decrease the level of
trust and psychological safety on our teams. Instead, we should seek to
understand the "other" in our midst; why does our PM have to ask a dev a
question so often? Is our documentation bad? Are we changing direction too
quickly?</p>
<p>A good working relationship allows both sides to understand each other better.
If we want to decrease the amount of interruptions we experience, posting
divisive tweets is a strategy that may actually have the opposite effect in the
long term. </p>
<p>Working alongside every member of our team is a much better strategy for
creating change than spreading insular, us vs them ideas.</p>
<h2>Taking matters into our hands</h2>
<p>We aren't helpless here; we can change our own behavior to address this issue.
Here's what's been most effective for me: taking notes. It's a simple but
powerful technique. A solid set of notes enables us to change contexts with
confidence, knowing that returning to a previous context will be easy.</p>
<p>Because of the time/effort it takes to gain, well, context on a certain task,
context switching is hard. Human brains have limited capacity for remembering
things like "What line was it that was causing that exception?" or "Which
features were most important in the last training of this model?".
Conveniently, computers are <em>great</em> at this kind of thing.</p>
<p>While I started taking notes to avoid keeping too much state in my brain, I have
realized a couple other benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record of results:</strong> as a Data Scientist, I do a lot of experiments. For new
  problems, I'll often try several different things. Seldom do they all work!
  My notes here function as a sort of "lab notebook", enabling me to review the
  experiments I've run and reflect on their implications (either by myself or
  with colleagues).</li>
<li><strong>Multiple projects:</strong> when I'm blocked on something, it's become much easier
  to switch to work on another project. Having a few projects at once is much
  easier to manage when the current state of each project is written down rather
  than in my head (or on JIRA).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Writing good notes</h2>
<p>So how do we take good notes? Here's what works for me. Each project gets a
document. While working on the project, I append things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surprising discoveries (for example textual descriptions, drawings, data
  visualizations)</li>
<li>Helpful bits of documentation (StackOverflow questions, company wiki)</li>
<li>Descriptions of what I'm trying to do and how I'm trying to do that. Even a
  few words or a file name and line number are enough to jog my memory.</li>
<li>Results of things I've tried. Did a certain test fail? What was the MSE when I
  include this feature?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a fractal process, so I find it useful to use bulleted lists with
multiple levels.</p>
<p>The particular medium we use for this isn't important. I use OneNote (because
its free tier offers everything I need), but there are a slew of other products
you can use. Digital note apps are convenient because they sync across devices,
but you could also use plaintext documents, paper notebooks, or even a
whiteboard if you prefer.</p>
<h2>You can do this!</h2>
<p>You may think that creating this set of notes is more trouble than it's worth.
What surprised me when I started doing this was that writing down my progress
ended up being fairly easy. All in all, it beats the heck out of losing your
place because someone interrupts you.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't a panacea. Being interrupted still can cause us to lose
track of things we haven't quite written down yet. And we do have to build the
habit of making good notes. But the costs are worth it.</p>
<h2>You <em>should</em> do this</h2>
<p>A written log of work gives us confidence that we can execute on our projects.
Because we track state for each project, we can stop worrying about forgetting
something valuable. Every time we step up to a task, we have a helpful record of
what our goal is and the ways we've tried to achieve it. We free up space in our
brain for more useful tasks.</p>
<p>A five minute meeting doesn't have to ruin your productivity. By letting
computers do what they're good at, we free our brains to do the difficult,
valuable intellectual work that most fulfills us. Take notes as you workâ€“it's
your new superpower.</p>
