<h1>The Last 5 Books I Read (October 2016)</h1>
<h2>Station Eleven, Emily St. John Mandel</h2>
<p>I picked up this book purely for entertainment, and it served that purpose well.
The pacing is quick (at times excessively so), and the events are interesting. I
found nothing about it revolutionary, but it was well-written. In particular, I
liked the dialogue because it felt real (perhaps accentuated by the fact that I
read the book aloud).</p>
<p>As events unfold in a few different timeframes, we see some characters and
events in a new light. While many of these unveilings worked well, they
sometimes felt like they were explaining too much, taking away some of the fun
of piecing together the story. Following these threads of story through various
timeframes is fun, but feels pointless sometimes. For instance, the author
traces a paperweight's journey which I didn't find engaging.</p>
<p>The characterization left something to be desired. Only once did I feel like I
understood a character at a non-surface level (the description of Miranda's
thoughts on clothes being "armor" gives insight into her post-divorce
life/feelings). Still, while I didn't end up caring very much about any of the
characters in particular, I kept reading because the story was interesting.</p>
<p>This book seems like one that many will like, but few will choose as their
favorite. That's completely fine; not every book can be a total masterpiece. Go
into it looking to be entertained, and you probably will be.</p>
