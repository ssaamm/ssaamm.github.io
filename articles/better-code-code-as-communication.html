<h1>Writing Better Code: Code as Communication</h1>
<p>After we compile our code, why do we keep it? The machine is able to interpret
the compiled code and perform the function we wanted it to, so why keep the
original code around? Often, the answer to this question is that we may need to
modify the program in the future. Modifying a bunch of 1's and 0's in a compiled
file would be very costly in terms of developer time. We keep the original code
because we can maintain it more easily than the compiled code.</p>
<p>Code is read more often than it is written. As such, when we are writing code,
we should keep future developers in mind. Our code is a tool for communicating
with future developers who are attempting to maintain it. I find two worthwhile
ways to make code more communicative.</p>
<h2>Avoid unnecessary comments</h2>
<p>Only write comments that explain something which isn't apparent after reading
the code.</p>
<p>As an example, suppose we're writing an application that interacts with a web
API to get the current weather. We might write something like this:</p>
<pre><code>r = requests.get('http://weather.example.com/currentweather?zip=76706')
</code></pre>
<p>A bad comment for this code might look like this:</p>
<pre><code># make a GET request to the weather API for a given ZIP code
r = requests.get('http://weather.example.com/currentweather?zip=76706')
</code></pre>
<p>This comment is unnecessary because it's more or less restating what the code
says. Any developer reading this code sans the comment will be able to surmise
that it makes a GET request to some weather API for some ZIP code. Because
developers can figure this out without the comment, the comment is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Unnecessary comments are unnecessary; who would've guessed? More interestingly,
I would argue that they can be harmful. In the future, the API and our use of it
may change in a number of ways. Suppose we want to lookup weather with a
latitude/longitude coordinate or that the developers of the API require us to
make a POST request. We open our code back up, find the line where we look up
the weather, and modify it</p>
<pre><code># make a GET request to the weather API for a given ZIP code
r = requests.post('http://weather.example.com/currentweather?lat=31.5491667&amp;lon=-97.1463889')
</code></pre>
<p>Oops! In our haste to update our code, we forgot to update the comment above it,
which is now an incorrect description of the code below it. Our program
continues to work just fine (the compiler or interpreter doesn't care about the
comments), but we've left a confusing artifact for the next developer to find.
Unnecessary comments are harmful because they can become out of sync with the
code they are describing, creating confusion and slowing down developers.</p>
<p>A better comment might look like this:</p>
<pre><code># get current weather in Waco
r = requests.get('http://weather.example.com/currentweather?zip=76706')
</code></pre>
<p>This comment is better because it's speaking to the reasoning for the code below
it. As a rule of thumb, comments should describe the <em>why</em> rather than the
<em>what</em>. Because this comment describes the <em>why</em> rather than the <em>what</em>, it is
still true when we modify our code as we did abobe--we're still getting the
current weather in Waco.</p>
<p>Still, I don't love this comment. It's probably unnecessary, as a developer can
probably figure out that we're getting the weather (though they may not know
Waco's ZIP code). At the same time, we may not want future developers to
have to take the time to read this code thoroughly; that's wy we wrote a comment
in the first place! If our intent is to create a program that is easily read and
understood, I think there are often better tools than comments.</p>
<h2>Write self-documenting code</h2>
<p>Name and create the constructs of your programs in such a way as to be easily
read and understood by future maintainers.</p>
<p>In our previous example, we were getting the current weather in a given place.
Because we didn't want a future developer to have to read our code in order to
understand it, we wrote a comment explaining what it did. Alternatively, we
could have created a well-named function:</p>
<pre><code>def get_current_weather(zip_code):
    return requests.get(f'http://weather.example.com/currentweather?zip={zip_code}')
</code></pre>
<p>Using this function might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>get_current_weather(zip_code=76706)
</code></pre>
<p>Because the function's behavior is easy to infer from its name, maintainers
don't have to read the definition of <code>get_current_weather</code> to understand what it
does (though they can easily choose to). Further, changes to the function can be
enforced by the interpreter. Suppose we modify this function to take a
latitude/longitude coordinate:</p>
<pre><code>def get_current_weather(lat, lon):
    return requests.get(f'http://weather.example.com/currentweather?lat={lat}&amp;lon={lon}')
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if we try to run our program without updating our calls to that function,
the interpreter will tell us:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: get_current_weather() got an unexpected keyword argument 'zip_code'
</code></pre>
<p>By creating a well-named function, we not only improved our program's
readability, we also made it harder for maintainers to break our program
unintentionally.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You should be thoughtful about the code you write because the marginal cost of
being a bit more thoughtful on writing the code is less than the cost of the
additional time future developers will have to spend in order to read your code.</p>
