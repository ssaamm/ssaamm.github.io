<h1>Hackathon report: TAMUHack 2015</h1>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>Two weeks ago, <a href="/articles/hacktx-2015.html">I went to HackTX</a> and won a Leap
Motion. While thinking about what things we could build with skeletal tracking
and gesture recognition, I thought it would be cool to build a language learning
tool (like Rosetta Stone) for American Sign Language. My friend
<a href="http://matttinsley.org/">Matt</a> also thought it sounded cool, so we decided to
build something like that at TAMUHack.</p>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>TAMUHack was fun. The venue was called "The Zone", which is a big room in A&amp;M's
stadium. All 300 of us were in this massive room, along eight big tables. Being
in the same room as everyone else was really cool; you felt like you were all a
part of something. I've been to other hackathons where I've not been able to
find a seat in the main areas; being separated from the rest of the teams is not
fun. The organizers of TAMUHack found a great solution to that problem--put
everyone together!</p>
<h2>Project evolution</h2>
<p>We started to build something that would simply transcribe signs of the ASL
alphabet as a user signed them above the Leap Motion. By around
<a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/sign-language-tutor/commit/35aac3168fd37a984087dc269607aa815e382fc8">3:00am</a>,
we had that more or less working. Playing around with it, we knew it definitely
wasn't perfect, but it showed promise.</p>
<p>The Leap Motion is not particularly well-suited to sign language recognition. In
our research during the hackathon, we found a research paper that said the Leap
Motion in its current state <a href="http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/59247/89839_1.pdf">isn't a good choice for recognizing Australian Sign
Language</a>.</p>
<p>As an initial run at solving this, we decided to implement some simple Markov
chain analysis. The idea was that if certain letters commonly precede others, we
should be able to figure out that a person signing "q" will probably sign "u"
next. That idea didn't end up helping us out all that much; we tore it out
later. After we input some more training data, the recognition was good enough
that we could work with it.</p>
<p>At that point, we had some time left and felt like we could keep going to make
something cooler than what we had. We decided to make the language learning tool
we'd originally planned on making. By
<a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/sign-language-tutor/commit/90bed1fbe605bec0932b3ccb6e41e685dc70ea3b">8:00am</a>,
we had a basic version working. The app would show you a picture of a sign and
ask you to replicate it. Once you had, it would give you 100 points and pick
another sign for you to make. After 30 seconds, you could enter your score on
our leaderboard. We decided to make our project into a game because it seemed
like a fun way to demo the tech we had built.</p>
<p>We ended up
<a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/sign-language-tutor/commit/c0fb39b539a579419516ae6e6bcfc2b59452caf2">finishing</a>
about an hour before projects were due. We were so happy to have built something
so cool and fun to make in such a short amount of time.</p>
<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>We set up our area with our laptops and the two external monitors we brought. We
each ran a copy of our app on an external monitor and had the Leap Motion
visualizer on our laptop screens. This ended up being super useful; we could
show people what the Leap Motion was seeing in real time.</p>
<p>Getting to show off our project to judges and other hackers was super fun.
People thought it was super cool and were excited to play around with it.</p>
<p>We got into the top six and were asked to present at closing cermonies. Awesome!
It was a little rushed because things were running late, but I still enjoyed
getting to talk about our hack in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Apparently the judges also thought it was cool, because Matt and I won second
place overall!</p>
<h2>Thanks</h2>
<p>TAMUHack was super fun. Huge thanks to the organizers, volunteers, and judges.</p>
