<h1>The Last 5 Books I Read (as of March 2017)</h1>
<h2>The Braindead Megaphone, George Saunders</h2>
<p>This collection of nonfiction essays was enjoyable and thought-provoking.
Saunders writes about the Iraq war, illegal immigration, and Dubai. He presents
his experiences in a very relatable way.</p>
<h2>The Crying of Lot 49, Thomas Pynchon</h2>
<p>I didn't like this one. I put it down about halfway through; I just couldn't get
into it. I didn't find anything about it intriguing in the slightest.</p>
