<h1>Notes: Boston Python User Group, Lightning Talks, 22 June 2015</h1>

<p>On 22 June 2015, the Boston Python User Group had a night of seven lightning
talks. These are notes I took for personal use; they're not a perfect re-telling
of what each talk was about (or even what each talk was called).</p>

<h2>#1 Python for making connections in groups</h2>

<h3>Speaker: John Hess</h3>

<p>John and a friend distant from him in his social graph each ended up being stood
up by friends at the same bar. They decided to sit down and solve the world's
problems. They ended up enjoying their time, so John wanted to find a way to
automate this sort of process.</p>

<p>The idea is something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>A group of people sign up on <a href="mavenbot.com">Maven</a></li>
<li>The service selects a group of about 4-6 people and texts them to see if
they're available</li>
<li>As people accept or decline invitations to the event, Maven will text more
people from the group to get them in on the event</li>
<li>Maven then puts everyone into a group message so they can organize the event</li>
</ul>

<p>John found that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Building stuff is easy in Python</li>
<li>Python is a Swiss army knife, but it can't do everything (for example, mobile
development)</li>
<li>While building stuff is easy, building stuff that is user friendly is <em>really
hard</em>
<ul>
<li>John kept iterating, putting the product in front of friends, getting
feedback, and trying new things</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>#2 Django cloud management</h2>

<h3>Speaker: Robert Paul Chase</h3>

<p>I was semi-lost on this one. The project was related to genetics somehow, and I
know nothing about computational genetics.</p>

<p>He built a cloud management platform that lets biologists and researchers (read:
not developers) easily spin up nodes, install necessary software, run their
code, and kill their cluster when they're done with it.</p>

<h2>#3 <code>.format()</code>ing without tears</h2>

<h3>Speaker: Richard Landau</h3>

<p>The standard <code>str.format()</code> method in Python will throw a <code>KeyError</code> if a name
isn't found in the dictionary. Rick made his own function to avoid that problem.
Here's how it works:</p>

<ul>
<li>Uses a regex to get the names both with and without braces (e.g. "{foo}" and
"foo")</li>
<li>Zips those two arrays together (to get <code>('foo', '{foo}'), ('bar', '{bar}'),
('baz', '{baz}')</code>)</li>
<li>Constructs a dictionary from that array (the format of the tuples will work
with <code>dict()</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>At first, it seemed to me like another way to implement this behavior would be
to provide <code>.format()</code> with a dictionary that, instead of throwing a <code>KeyError</code>
when encountering an unknown key, would return a modified version of the key
which was asked for. I tried to do that, and it turns out that doesn't work</p>

<pre><code>class FancyDict(object):
    def __init__(self, dictionary):
        self.__dictionary = dictionary

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        try:
            return self.__dictionary[key]
        except KeyError:
            return '{' + key + '}'

    def keys(self):
        return self.__dictionary.keys()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    params = { 'foo': 'this is foo', 'bar': 'this is bar', 'baz': 'this is baz' }
    print '{foo} {bar} {baz}'.format(**params)
    # this is foo this is bar this is baz

    params = { 'foo': 'this is foo', 'bar': 'this is bar' }
    print '{foo} {bar} {baz}'.format(**params)
    # KeyError: 'baz'

    params = FancyDict({ 'foo': 'this is foo', 'bar': 'this is bar' })
    print '{foo} {bar} {baz}'.format(**params)
    # KeyError: 'baz'
</code></pre>

<p><code>str.format()</code> gets the keys of the dictionary and will throw a <code>KeyError</code> if
any of the strings in curly braces are absent.</p>

<h2>#4 Test all the data</h2>

<h3>Speaker: Eric J Ma</h3>

<ul>
<li>Testing data is important because you have some assumptions about it that may
not always be correct</li>
<li>He talked some more about how to do that using PyTest</li>
</ul>

<h2>#5 Visualizing Yeast ChIP-Seq data</h2>

<h3>Speaker: Luis Soares</h3>

<p>I was completely out of my league on the domain of this one, which was something
related to biology.</p>

<p>It looked like a neat web-based visualization project.</p>

<h2>#6 Payment reform</h2>

<h3>Speaker: James Santucci</h3>

<p>I wasn't super familiar with the domain (statistics).</p>

<p>The big takeaway was that how we measure value affects how much value we
observe. I'm not sure what that means.</p>

<h2>#7 Hypothesis: property-based testing</h2>

<h3>Speaker: Matt Bachmann</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hypothesis is a Python library inspired by Haskell's QuickCheck</li>
<li>You put a decorator on your test to say what kind of data it takes</li>
<li>It works with most testing frameworks</li>
<li>You write a small amount of code, but get a big amount of functionality tested</li>
</ul>
