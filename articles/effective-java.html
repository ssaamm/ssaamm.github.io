<h1>Thoughts on Effective Java</h1>

<p>I'm reading the second edition of <em>Effective Java</em> in a group at work and
writing some thoughts/notes about it here.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p><strong>Item 1</strong> is about static factory methods.</p>

<p>The leader of my group offered a point that static factory methods can be hard
to mock. I don't have a ton of experience at this time with mocking objects, so
I haven't seen that first hand, but I'll trust him and keep it in mind for the
future.</p>

<p><strong>Item 1, advantage 4</strong> says that static factory methods are good because they
reduce verbosity in creating objects. The example they give is:</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; m = new HashMap&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Java 7 introduces the diamond operator, so this can become:</p>

<pre><code>Map&lt;String, List&lt;String&gt;&gt; m = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>thereby negating the verbosity-decreasing benefit of static factory methods.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to say the book is wrong. It says "Revised and Updated for
Java SE 6" on the cover, and for Java 6, that seems like a valid argument. I
just think it's interesting how new language features can change what constitues
a best practice. The book even says, "Someday the language may perform this sort
of type inference on constructor invocations as well as method invocations."</p>

<p><strong>Item 2</strong> is about builders.</p>

<p>In the process of talking about builders, the author talks about the JavaBeans
pattern. This pattern seems like a terrible idea to me; forgetting to set a
required parameter is relatively easy and could have disastrous results. The
Builder pattern seems like a better choice because it's a way to give the
compiler more information. I would rather have my IDE yell at me at compile time
that my object isn't instantiated correctly than wrestle with bugs at run time.</p>

<p>Builders do introduce more code to write/maintain/test, but (as my group leader
pointed out) the IDE can generate the class for you.</p>

<p>The book has required parameters going in the builder's constructor and optional
parameters being set by additional methods. My question is: what if the number
of required parameters gets large? Then you haven't solved your problem at all.
One option would be to move the required parameters into methods, but then
you're not providing the compiler with the information to know that some of the
parameters are required. Yes, the <code>build()</code> method can check for them and
perhaps throw an exception, but that only happens at run time.</p>

<p>I think that if you have so many required parameters, there might be something
wrong with your design. Perhaps some arguments are logically related and should
be combined into an instance of a new class which binds them together. I'm not
sure if this is always the case, but it seems like it often would be.</p>

<p><strong>Item 3</strong> talks about singletons.</p>

<p>Our group leader told us to beware of the hidden state that often comes along
with singletons. I have definitely run into that issue. When functions use state
that is not from a parameter, things can get tricky. Knowing what state is used
and how that will affect the execution of the function can be difficult for the
developer.</p>

<p>While the book says that, "a single-element enum type is the best way to
implement a singleton," our leader disagreed. He argues that using an <code>enum</code> is
less readable. I had a similar gut feeling when I first read this part of the
Item; I would not have thought to use an <code>enum</code> to implement a singleton. In my
mind, an <code>enum</code> represents an enumeration of a few different kinds of things; a
singleton is something that there will only ever be one of. These two ideas seem
at odds.</p>

<p><strong>Item 4</strong> talks about noninstantiable classes. These classes are often used for
utility methods.</p>

<p>Again, apparently static things are difficult to mock. And Java's garbage
collector has apparently gotten good enough that doing something like <code>(new
FileUtility()).getPermissions(file)</code> will result in the created <code>FileUtility</code>
being garbage collected very quickly. This all happens fast enough that there is
very little performance impact.</p>

<p><strong>Item 7</strong> says to avoid finalizers. I learned C++ in school, so the lack of
guarantees with finalizers throws me off. In any case, I've never heard someone
seriously advocate for finalizer usage.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p><strong>Item 8</strong> is about the general contract for equals. The terms used in the
contract are familiar from discrete math.</p>

<p>For value objects, you want to override <code>equals()</code>. <code>equals()</code> gets tricky when
inheritance comes into play, though. One solution to that problem is to not use
inheritance with value object -- make your value objects <code>final</code>. Inheritance
can be useful for business logic, so feel free to use inheritance in that case.
For classes that implement business logic, though, it doesn't make much sense to
implement <code>equals()</code>.</p>

<p>An interesting thing I hadn't thought about is that <code>instanceof</code> checks for
null:</p>

<pre><code>public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        String nullString = null;
        System.out.println(nullString instanceof String);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>false
</code></pre>

<p>One suggestion was to use an <code>EqualsBuilder</code>, like the one supplied in Apache
Commons. Apparently, equals builders will help you avoid NPE's. To me, this
seems like a cop-out. I don't think it's too terribly difficult to avoid writing
an <code>equals()</code> method which won't throw an NPE; perhaps I haven't written enough
Java.</p>

<p><strong>Item 9</strong> is about <code>hashCode()</code>. Equal objects must have equal hash codes.</p>

<p>The book contains an overview of how to write a <code>hashCode()</code> method that's good
enough. Ground-breaking, cutting-edge, crazy high-performance hashing functions
are going to be class-specific. Sometimes, this is fairly obvious; if your class
has a unique ID, you can just return that as your hash code.</p>

<p><strong>Item 10</strong> is about <code>toString()</code>. This method should only be used for debugging
or logging purposes.</p>

<p>The <code>StringBuilder</code> class gets this wrong--its <code>toString()</code> method is used for
programmatic access to the string that is being built. It should probably have
another method called <code>build()</code> to provide programmatic access, and leave
<code>toString()</code> for logging purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Item 11</strong> is about <code>clone()</code>. To be frank, I find the <code>Cloneable</code> interface
confusing, and I haven't run into a good use for it.</p>

<p><strong>Item 12</strong> is about <code>compareTo()</code>. The hard thing with <code>compareTo()</code> is that
it's not particularly explicit about what the "natural" ordering means. By
contrast, a <code>Comparator&lt;&gt;</code> can have a name which gives developers more
information about how the comparison is done. This explicit information is
probably good.</p>

<p>As of Java 7, if you break the general contract for comparisons, an exception
will be thrown.</p>
