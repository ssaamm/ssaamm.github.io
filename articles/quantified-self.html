<h2>How many times in a row do I typically sneeze?</h2>
<p>Ever since I can remember, I've sneezed atypically. While most people sneeze
once and are done, I often sneeze 3, 4, or even 8 times in a row. I was curious
to see how often I sneeze a certain number of times in a row, so I kept track of
every time I sneezed over the course of a week. Here are the results:</p>

<p>All this time, I though it was fairly rare for me to sneeze once. In reality, I
sneeze once in a row with decent frequency, and I sneeze twice very
infrequently.</p>
