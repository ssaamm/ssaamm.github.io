<h1>Hackathon report: HackTX 2015</h1>
<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>My team and I started thinking of ideas on the drive down to Austin. We ended up
deciding to do something that would automate the scheduling of meetings.</p>
<h2>Project</h2>
<p>We started writing a Python/Flask app hosted on Azure. Getting the project
deployed initially was easy, as was setting up continuous integration. Last
year, we wrote a PHP web app, and none of us were able to use our computers to
test. In essence, the production server was also our development server. Using
Flask was awesome because it comes with a development server.</p>
<p>Wes started to work on the UI, I worked on figuring out a way to read people's
emails with Context.IO, and Evan worked on user account management. He started
to use Flask-User, but then we couldn't get it to work on the Azure
configuration we had set up. It was late at night, I wasn't sure what other
library to use, and Wes was starting to hate Python, so we made a hard decision
and switched everything to PHP.</p>
<p>At this point, we had to set up DeployBot to do continuous integration, and we
went back to the issue of not having servers to do development on. As a result,
the git log got pretty terrible.</p>
<p>I got a script to check a user's email inbox for emails that looked like someone
trying to schedule a meeting and set it up to run on a cron job while Evan
worked on our SendGrid integration.</p>
<p>The actual scheduling logic came into play much later in the day than we would
have hoped. Luckily, it didn't turn out to be too challenging, so we were able
to get it implemented and finally create our app's core functionality.</p>
<p>In the end, our product was definitely more hacky than any of us would have
liked, but it worked well enough to demonstrate.</p>
<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>Once again, presentations were "science fair" style this year, which was great.
Several judges came around and asked about our project. Our pitch was something
like this:</p>
<p>I've been doing job hunting lately, which involves a good amount of emailing
back and forth to coordinate interviews. This process is a tedious chore; sounds
like a job for computers! We built Schedule Ninja, an awesome computerized ninja
that slices and dices your meetings so you don't have to.</p>
<p>Users log in with their Google account, which we use to pull in their
availability through Google Calendar. We read their email in order to find
messages that look like someone trying to set up a meeting. From those emails,
we generate a request on the user's dashboard that they can either accept or
deny. If they accept the request, Schedule Ninja emails the requester back with
the user's availability and asks them to click a link to confirm their meeting
time.</p>
<p>Schedule Ninja can also be used to request a meeting with someone else. The user
types in an email address, and we detect whether that person is on our service.
If they are, we are able to avoid email altogether, compare the two people's
schedules, and set up a meeting for them automatically.</p>
<p>We got some great feedback from several judges who wanted to sign up for the
service immediately. That felt very validating; we had built something users
actually wanted! Unfortunately, we didn't place overall, but we did end up
winning sponsor prizes from Microsoft and Indeed.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We had a lot of fun and built a useful product in 24 hours. Big thanks to the
HackTX organizers, Context.IO, Square, Microsoft, and Indeed for all their
feedback and help. If you've not gone to a hackathon, you should definitely sign
up! They're super fun!</p>
