<h1>Hackathon report: Hack@Teal 2015</h1>

<p>My friend <a href="http://matttinsley.org/">Matt Tinsley</a> and I were both RA's in Teal
Resdiential College from Fall 2014 to Spring 2015. We are also both big fans of
hackathons. Matt had the idea for and led the organization of a hackathon for
Teal residents. I helped him out with logistics, and we worked on a project in
the time we weren't doing organizer-y things.</p>

<p>The first two sections of this article relate to organizing the event, and the
third is about the project I worked on.</p>

<h2>Successes</h2>

<p>Lots of things went well.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Learning</strong> -- Many people during demos said something to the effect of,
"I've never done anything like this project before today. I learned so much."
Our faculty master was impressed with how much people were able to learn,
which was good seeing as he funded much of the event. Education was also a
huge reason we wanted to have the event, so it was great to see our efforts
pay off.</li>
<li><strong>Team/idea formation</strong> -- At the beginning of the event, we had some time for
individuals who came to the event to find a team. Matt and I stood in a circle
with the individuals, and we all went around and said an idea we had. This
format worked well; the four people we had formed two teams. I would recommend
that organizers bring some simple ideas for people to work on; both of my
ideas ended up getting used.</li>
<li><strong>Venue</strong> -- Teal allowed us to use the media room, which had ample space. We
were also able to bring over plenty of tables from a neighboring classroom.</li>
<li><strong>Google forms</strong> -- good choice for our voting needs. I could imagine that for
larger hackathons, there would be too many votes to use Google forms, but it
was just what we needed for how many participants we had.</li>
<li><strong>Food</strong> -- We had ample food, people seemed to like it well enough.</li>
<li><strong>Hosting</strong> -- We had one team who wanted to do some stuff with web
technologies, but didn't have much of an idea what they were doing. I spun up
a VPS through <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=3dc2cdcca705">Digital
Ocean</a>, and <a href="http://www.wescossick.com/">Wes
Cossick</a> explained a few basic things to them.
Like that, they were off!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hardships</h2>

<p>A few things were less than perfect.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Staying through the night</strong> -- I wish more people had chosen to stay through
the night. Around 4 or 5 am, the room started to feel dead.</li>
<li><strong>Judging</strong> -- Our faculty master did a great job of judging, but I think it
would have been cool to have gotten a panel of judges rather than just one
person.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My project</h2>

<p>Matt and I worked on <a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/emoji-predictor">Emoji
Predictor</a>. If you've ever used a
smartphone keyboard that suggests words as you type, you'll understand what it
is. Our project suggests relevant emojis for you to use in your text messages.</p>

<p>We started with a database of all Matt's text messages. This would be our
"corpus", or the body of text we would use to make inferences about which emojis
should be used with which kinds of messages.</p>

<p>While making an iOS keyboard would have been really cool, we wanted to make a
proof of concept and focus on the part of the project we found interesting:
getting from a string to the emojis most relevant to it. We decided to make a
web UI. I whipped up a simple application using Python, Flask, and JavaScript
(our code can be found on
<a href="https://github.com/ssaamm/emoji-predictor">GitHub</a>).</p>

<p>While I was working on the UI side of things, Matt started working on the
recommendation engine using Python Natural Language Toolkit. While he worked on
that, I decided to work on a different implementation of a recommendation
engine. I loaded all of Matt's sent messages which contained emojis into
Elasticsearch and ran a query on that index using user input. This basic
implementation ended up working decently enough.</p>

<p>Matt ended up having tons of trouble with Python and unicode, so for demo
purposes we went with my implementation. I thought our product was pretty neat.</p>

<p>Because it relied on Matt's personal information, a live demo unfortunately
isn't up anywhere.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Despite a few minor problems, Hack@Teal went very well. I was glad to help, and
I'd love to take part in organizing more hackathons. Because it was a small
event, Matt and I were able to hack on our own project, which was fun and
educational.</p>
