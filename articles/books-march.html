<h2>Questions for All your Answers, Roger E. Olson</h2>
<p>This would have been a good book to give a 13 year old version of myself. At
that time, I was struggling with how anti-intellectual the church seemed.
Fortunately, for a few reasons I came to find and appreciate the intellectual
tradition of Christianity. As such, I don't think I'm necessarily the target
audience for the book. Reading it is still enjoyable, but it's not
earth-shattering for me.</p>
<p>More generally, Olson seems to be caught in the awkward task of speaking
intellectually and theologically to an audience hostile (or apathetic, at best)
toward theological thinking. His writing feels at times pulled in different
direction. In one corner, he's trying to explain complicated theological lines
of thought. In another corner, he's trying to keep it simple enough that people
without much theological background can understand it.</p>
<p>That said, there are still parts of the book that I liked. The third chapter was
particularly good; it talks about cultural sensitivity and the Trinity in a very
practical way that still respects the ideas.</p>
