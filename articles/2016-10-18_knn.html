<h1>k-Nearest Neighbors</h1>
<p>On 18 Oct 2016, I gave a talk at Austin ACM SIGKDD on the <em>k</em>-nearest neighbors
algorithm. Topics included some machine learning theory (approximation vs.
generalization, VC dimension), the algorithm itself, proving the algorithm's
performance, and some practical concerns around choosing <em>k</em>.</p>
<p>Some other topics that I would probably include next time are similarity
functions, high-dimensional spaces, and categorical data.</p>
<p>You can find the slides <a href="/static/pdf/2016-10-18_knn.pdf">here</a>. Note that my
presentation probably won't make a ton of sense from these slides, as they were
mostly aids to the words I was saying out loud. If you've got any questions,
feel free to email me; I'd love to chat!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who came to watch; I appreciated hearing your feedback!</p>
