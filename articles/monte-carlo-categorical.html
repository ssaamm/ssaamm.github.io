<h1>Monte Carlo Simulation with Categorical Values</h1>
<p>We live in a world of imperfect information. When faced with a lack of data, we can make a guess. This guess could be
far from the truth; it could be spot on. In Monte Carlo simulation, we repeatedly make guesses of some unknown value
according to some distribution and are able to report on the results of that simulation to understand a little bit more
about the unknown. While any one guess may be far from the truth, in aggregate those outliers don't have as much of an
effect.</p>
<p>I ran into a situation where I was gathering some data with some level of imperfection. My stakeholder wanted to know
what the impact of that imperfection on the important metrics would be. I could have made a guess, but instead I turned
to the data. Initially, I thought to calculate the best case and worst case scenarios. This idea is useful in that it
gives you a range on what you don't know, but it's also beneficial to know how likely each of those scenarios (and
things in between) are. That's where Monte Carlo simulation comes in handy.</p>
<p>For the purposes of context, let's use a contrived example. Suppose I run a car dealership, and a major hail storm
rolled through last weekend. Some of my cars suffer major damage and will incur a 10% loss in their value, some suffered
minor damage incurring a 5% loss, and some suffered no damage at all. I don't have enough labor to survey every single
one of my cars, but I do want to know how much money I can expect to lose. I randomly select 500 of my 1000 cars and see
how bad the damage was.</p>
<p>Hypothetically, it's possible that the 500 cars I inspected were the only ones that happened to have been damaged by the
hail (maybe the rest were safe in my 500-car warehouse). That would be the best case scenario, in which case I suffer
only the loss on the cars I inspected. In the worst case scenario, every car I didn't inspect suffered major damage. For
some random data I generate below, we know that the amount of damage done to the uninspected cars is somewhere between 0
and around $1.75 million dollars. This is a huge range of possibilities!</p>
<p>We see that looking at the best case and worst case gets us some bounds on how bad the damage could be, but we have no
idea how probable each of these options are (let alone the probability of the values in the middle). To find out how bad
the damage is likely to be, we can turn to Monte Carlo simulation.</p>
<p>First, let's randomly generate our inventory, then inspect half of our cars. While we know the <code>value</code> of each car, we
think of the <code>damage_pct</code> as an unknown value for the cars we do not inspect.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>We can see the distribution of <code>damage_pct</code> among the sampled cars is<sup>1</sup>:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>damage_pct</th>
  <th>prob</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>-0.1</td>
  <td>0.096</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>-0.05</td>
  <td>0.490</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>0.00</td>
  <td>0.414</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Because we inspected a random subset of the cars, a reasonable simplifying assumption is that the damage to the
uninspected cars has the same distribution as that of the inspected cars. With that assumption, we can simulate the
damage done to the uninspected cars like so:</p>

<p>To make sense of the output of these 1000 simulations, we can calculate some descriptive statistics. It's also helpful
to look at the CDF of the simulated damage.</p>

<p>We can say that in half of our simulations, the damage was somewhere between $671,499.96 and $595,382.30. This range is
about 4.3% the size of the range between the best and worst case scenarios.</p>
<p>How'd we do? Because we made up the dataset, we can calculate the true value and put that number on the graph above:</p>

<p>In "reality", the true amount of damage done was $607,830.94, which just so happens to be in that window of 50% of our
simulations.</p>
<p>We can run this experiment a few more times to see how this method fares:</p>

<p>The next time you're trying to reason about some unknown value, consider using Monte Carlo simulation to inform your
decision-making process.</p>
<hr />
<p>1: While the values for <code>damage_pct</code> look like numerical data, remember that they are representative of the three
categories of damage sustained (none, minor, or major).</p>
